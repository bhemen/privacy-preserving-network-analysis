# problems

I keep getting an error: `RSA public encrypt error`. Some times I got this include:
- Assigning a float to an array
- dividing float by float and assigning to an array
- casting from int to float and vice versa

Once it looked like there was a problem with the autogenerated code (mixed up assignment order)

What all of these have in common is that I was declaring a bunch of variables. When I take the variable declarations out, I don't get those errors in some cases. I haven't tested every case.

---
The `smcinput` function is subject to a very limited parser. The party parameter must be a literal (no variable for id) and the statement must appear in the code exactly as many times as it is called (e.g. don't put it in a function and call the function, don't put it in a for loop).
